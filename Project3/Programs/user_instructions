Hello,
 
user(not world this time) of my program !

This program is very simple. 

To compile: Run "make" in the terminal

Then you will be asked to choose between Gaussian quadrature- and Monte carlo-methods.
	
	For Gaussian quadrature
		Enter "0"

		Then enter the integration limits [a,b] (will only be used for GQ-Legendre) and number of 
		integration points in the following order:

		a
		b
		N

	For Monte carlo
		Enter "1"

		Then enter number of monte carlo cycles, N

		N
